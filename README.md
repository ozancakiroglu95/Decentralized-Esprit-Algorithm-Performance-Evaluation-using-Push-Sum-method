This repo will include experimental results of my master thesis...

To summarize my master thesis, I am trying to calculate the arriving 2D angles of some signals which are emitted from some antennas or sensors (source signal can be created by any kind of signal generator) to a certain field (this field consists of distributed sensor groups in my thesis). There are lots of methods known as DOA algorithms like MUSIC, Root-Music, ESPRIT which are already calculating the arriving 2D angles of the source signals. However the main aim in this thesis will be to implement one of the DOA algorithms as decentralized. 

The meaning of the decentralization can easily be thought as lack of centralized processor which is the essential part for calculating the arriving angle after receiving the signals with sensors. Instead of centaralized processor, decentralized algorithms exploit the collobaration of all sensors, which are smart and can make some easy calculations, to make necessary calculations. One of the methods which provides this type of decentralized calculations is called as Push-Sum method which will be exploited in my master thesis to translate centralized ESPRIT algortihm(one of the DOA algorithms) to dencentralized ESPRIT algorithm...
